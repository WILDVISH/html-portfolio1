<p>This is my favourite anime movie. i'm not one to cry while watching movies,but i've seen A Silent Voice
    three times now and get emotional everytime. It is a simple story but that carries so much weight in its
    themes and messages-the kind of movie everybody should watch at least once.

<h3>John Wick</h3>

<p>John Wick is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that redefines the action genre.
    From the very first scene to the last, the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go,
    taking you on a thrilling roller-coaster ride of non-stop adrenaline-pumping action and raw emotion.
