<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a professional procrastinator who likes to binge-watch Netflix and eat pizza. I also enjoy traveling, reading, and writing,
  but only when I have a deadline looming over me. I'm a master of disguise who can blend in with any crowd. I've been mistaken for a spy,
  a celebrity, and a mime. I'm also fluent in six languages, including sarcasm and gibberish. I'm a unicorn who loves rainbows, glitter, and
  cupcakes. I have a magical horn that grants wishes and a tail that sparkles in the sun. I'm also allergic to negativity and boring people.

<p>My favorite quote is "Be yourself"; everyone else is already taken.” by Oscar Wilde. It's also my motto and my excuse for being weird.</p>

<p>I'm a certified nerd who can recite all the digits of pi, solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute, and quote every line from Star Wars.
  I'm also a hopeless romantic who believes in love at first sight, soulmates, and happy endings.
  I'm a rebel without a cause who likes to break the rules and live on the edge.
  I've been arrested for jaywalking, fined for littering, and banned from the library for talking too loud.
  I'm also a loyal friend who will always have your back.
  I'm a simple person who likes pretty, shiny things. And puppies. And chocolate. And pizza. And wine. And cheese. And…wait, what was I saying?
  I'm a paradox wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. Or maybe I'm just a confused human being who doesn't know what to write here. Either way,
  I'm sure you'll find me fascinating.
